Connect your Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Air conditioning system to Homey.

Turn your HVAC unit on or off, set the temperature, and adjust the modeâ€”all through infrared technology. No need for a separate remote; it's all integrated.

This app allows Homey Bridge and Homey Pro to control Mitsubishi Heavy Industries AC units via Infrared, so you can control and automate them in the Homey app. Homey Pro or Homey Bridge need to be in te same room as your AC system, as infrared signals to not travel through walls.
